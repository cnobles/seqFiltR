# seqFiltR
[Dev] R-based tool for filtering a sequence file(s) based on supplied indices or another sequence file.

## Description
Sequence files may sometimes contain only a few reads relevant to an analysis, or host a number of reads needing to be removed. Removal of unwanted sequences, or selection of desired sequences, can help with reducing downstream analysis and requirements. The **seqFiltR** tool is designed to do both positive and negative selection by indices (matching sequence names) for fasta and fastq files. Further, if two fasta or fastq files are provided (such as from paired-end sequencing, R1 and R2) then only the intersect (positive selection) or unique (negative selection) reads will be selected.
